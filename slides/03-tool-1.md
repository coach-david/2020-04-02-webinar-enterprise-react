# âœ¨ Prettier

- Prettier is an **automatic** code formatter

## Obvious benefits

- Enforce consistent code style across the whole codebase

In combination with:

- IDE plugin: Automatically format your code on save
- Husky & pretty-quick: Automatically format your code on commit
- _Lightweight_ ESLint rules: Don't let ESLint get in the way of your development speed.

## Less obvious benefits of working with types

- If it can't be prettified, your code is broken!
  => Shorten "Code to Bug discovery"-feedback loop

- Get used to writing code without taking care of code style yourself!
  Let the tool work for you!
  => Improve code writing speed
