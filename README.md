# ⚛️ Enterprise-scale React with 5 tips & tools

In this practical 1-hour lunch & learn session, we'll take a small application to the next level in terms of scalability and maintainability. We prepare the application to last for the next decade, ready to face challenges like changing scope, evolving technologies and rotating team members.

We'll find answers to the following questions:

- How can I make my code easy to change?
- How to ensure I won't break anything?
- How can I share my code with other teams & applications?
- How can I keep my codebase consistent?
- How can I write documentation which is always up-to-date?

We'll see how Nrwl's Nx dev tools answers these questions and how they provide a framework for us to write robust React applications.

Projects without Nx can also benefit from these ideas and tools for a scalable React architecture.
